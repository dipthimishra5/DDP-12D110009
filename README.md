# Monte-Carlo simulation of interfacial energy calculations in soild-solid systems
(Dual Degree Project - IIT Bombay)

Author: Piyush Divyankar

## Aim
- To determine interfacial energies in binary alloy systems.
- To obtain the interfacial as a function of relative orientation.
- Using interfacial energies to make conclusions about microstructure evolution.

## Minimum Features
- Energy calculation using embedded atom method model.
- Chemical potential calculation(method of computation uncertain at the moment).
- Semi-grand cannonical Monte-Carlo to be implemented on the lattice.
- Good documentation. 

## Extra features
- Compressed storage of atomic crystal files.

## Long term goals
- Making a general simulator for interfacial energy calculation.

## Current Status
- Energy calculation implemented.
- Auxillary functionality implemented.
- Working on fixing memory leaks.
