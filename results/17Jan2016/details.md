## What is this plot?

- Here i have plotted the change in enerigies that we encounter when we switch the spin at a random index on x-axis and frequency of these enerigies.

- This is a histogram plot

- Observations
    - **This is symmetric about 0:** Why??
    - **We see bands:** This is expebted because the neighours are at different distances that aren't continuous.
    - **Mean only considering absolute values: 0.86532eV**
    - **variance considering absolute values: 0.15374**
    - **Mean: -0.005**
    - **Variance: 0.90250**
